    <p>this paragraph is for absolute positioning
       it will position itself relative to its ancestor
       which have been marked as relative/fixed/sticky.
       It's original position is left free and can be occupied 
       by other elements beneath it unlike relative. 
       
       If it doesn't find any such ancestors, it sets relative 
       to the browser window
